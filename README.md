UFW
I used UFW on Kali Linux to configure basic firewall rules. I blocked port 23 (Telnet) and verified that connections were denied. Then I allowed SSH (port 22). Finally, I removed the block rule and restored the firewall to its default state.
This demonstrated how firewalls filter network traffic and improve security by controlling access to system
